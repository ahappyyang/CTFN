___________

The code in this toolbox implements the ["CTFN: Multi-scale CNN and Transformer with Graph Encodings Fusion Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification"]. 

    
System-specific notes
---------------------
The codes of networks were tested using PyTorch 1.12.1 version (CUDA 10.1) in Python 3.7 on Ubuntu system.

How to use it?
---------------------
Directly run **MAIN.py** functions with different network parameter settings to produce the results. Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper.

For the datasets:
Add your dataset path to function “load_dataset” in function.py
